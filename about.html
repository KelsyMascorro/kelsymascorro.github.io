  <p>Hello! Welcome to my page!</p>

  <p>I am a current graduate student at <a href="http://https://tamucc.edu/"><u>Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi</u></a>, where I am pursuing my Masters of Arts in English with a concentration in Writing Studies. I received my Bachelors of Arts in English and Teacher of English to Speakers of Other Languages certification from Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi in the Spring of 2017, and my certification as a Teacher of English for Grades 7-12 from the Texas Education Agency in the summer of 2018. </p>

  <p>When I first began my journey into the Masters program here at TAMUCC, I thought I wanted to pursue a career as an ESL professor, teaching English to international students at various college levels. Once I joined the university's <a href="http://cla.tamucc.edu/english/writing/fywp/index.html"><u>First Year Writing Program</u></a> as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, however, and began working with students in online spaces, I realized I loved teaching English online more.</p>

  <p>During the Spring of 2019, when faced with the issue of trying to get my online students to collaborate and engage in our digital classroom, I had the choice of either using the rigid structure of the Blackboard shell provided by the university or using software I was more familiar with - <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/"><u>the Google Suite</u></a>. I chose to use the G Suite because it allowed for more flexibility in content presentation within more of a welcoming environment than Blackboard allowed at the time, as well as tools that helped to foster collaboration in a new and engaging way.</p>

  <p>To this day, I utilize the G Suite's many features in my classroom and, through this blog, hope to showcase the revolutionary work I am doing in the field of online teaching.</p>
