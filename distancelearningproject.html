<p>For this Distance Learning Project, I investigated the last five issues of the <a href="http://peitho.cwshrc.org/">Peitho journal</a>. Peitho is a journal that focuses on topics of Feminism and the topics' relation to ideas of Writing and Rhetoric. On their website, the editors describe the journal as the intersection of "the Coalition of Feminist Scholars in the History of Rhetoric & Composition." Since the journal focuses on topics regarding Feminism and Writing/Rhetoric, I expected the highest counts of words to focus on women and concepts of writing.</p>

<p>In order to create the word clouds, I downloaded the isses in pdf form and uploaded them into the word cloud generator of <a href="http://wordclouds.com/">WordClouds.com</a>. While some of the issues were able to be downloaded from the Paitho website whole, other issues were only able to be downloaded article by article. In order to combine them into a single pdf that could be uploaded into the word cloud generator, I used <a href="https://combinepdf.com/">CombinePDF.com</a>, a pdf converter, to combine the individual pdfs into a single file.</p>

<p>Once each issue's single pdf was uploaded into the word cloud generator, I then narrowed down the word list by removing the name of the journal, variations of the word "Volume" or "Vol," variations of the names of months, numericals, the first names of the authors, and commonly used academic terms such as "might," "should," "i.e," and "can." This process left me with the most commonly used words that were unique to each issue.</p>

<p>The first issue I investigated was Volume 19, Issue 2. This issue focused on the topic of:</p>
