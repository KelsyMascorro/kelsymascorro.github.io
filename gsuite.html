		<h1> About My Work with the Google Suite</h1>

  <p>I am a current graduate student at <a href="https://tamucc.edu/"><u>Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi</u></a>, where I am pursuing my Masters of Arts in English with a concentration in Writing Studies. I received my Bachelors of Arts in English and Teacher of English to Speakers of Other Languages certification from Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi in the Spring of 2017, and my certification as a Teacher of English for Grades 7-12 from the Texas Education Agency in the summer of 2018. </p>

  <p>When I first began my journey into the Masters program here at TAMUCC, I thought I wanted to pursue a career as an ESL professor, teaching English to international students at various college levels. Once I joined the university's <a href="http://cla.tamucc.edu/english/writing/fywp/index.html"><u>First Year Writing Program</u></a> as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, however, and began working with students in online spaces, I realized I loved teaching English online more.</p>

  <p>During the Spring of 2019, when faced with the issue of trying to get my online students to collaborate and engage together in our digital classroom, I had the choice of either using the rigid structure of the Blackboard shell provided by the university or using software I was more familiar with - <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/"><u>the Google Suite</u></a>. I chose to use the G Suite because it allowed for more flexibility in content presentation, allowed for more of a welcoming environment than Blackboard did at the time, and provided access to tools that helped to foster collaboration in a new and engaging way.</p>

<img class="infographic" src="https://i.ibb.co/TL7NpWM/Utilizing-Google-Suite-to-Foster-collaboration.png" alt="Infographic describing elements of G-Suite" />

	<p>Some of these tools are listed in the infographic to the right. I created this infographic as a way to inform my colleagues about my teaching strategies and enable them to begin utilizing the Google Suite in their own classrooms. Like any app, the Google Suite requires users to play around with its functions and explore what's out there, especially when it comes to Google Chrome extensions and various tools within apps such as Docs and Slides themselves. But, with this infographic, I hope to provide those who are interested with a short summary of the features of the Google Suite.</p>

	<p>For the classes I teach, I utilize Google Sites to help organize the class content and give students a place where they can easily access the different folders and recources. While I could place links to the various folders on Blackboard, I choose to use Google Suites as a fun and interactive way to access the course content that is more engaging than the plain and stiff Blackboard shell. To submit assignments, students may either create a folder within the class Google Drive, or create a folder within their personal Google Drive and share it with me. I believe students should be held accountable for their own work, so I do not have my students submit their daily assignments on Blackboard, but rather organize them however they like within their own personal folders. By having the students use Google Docs to compose their assignments, I can keep track of when changes were made to the various documents, but also have students comment directly on each other's work. Google Slides is also great for having students collaborate together on assignments because students can leave each other comments in real time and work on presentations together, even though the students may not be in the same room together. Lastly, a couple additional tools I use sparingly in my courses are the Google extension "Screen Recorder" and the app Google Forms. The "Screen Recorder" extension allows me to record my screen so I can show students my annotations of our digital class readings, or I can turn the focus on myself and record my webcam so my students can see my face as I give a lecture. The best part is that the videos can be saved and uploaded to the class drive so students can watch them again and again. Google Forms is another cool Google Suite feature which allows me to poll the class anonymously to ask for feedback. The students can answer multiple choice questions, short answer responses, or larger extended responses. In order to identify students if I wanted to give my students a quiz using Google Forms, all I would have to do is make a required question where they would have to type in their name.</p>

	<p>Overall, I enjoy using the Google Suite in my classes and believe that the students enjoy the Google Suite as well. They have told me that the class is engaging and interactive in ways other classes are not, and when I taught the Writing and Rhetoric class online, my students left me feedback saying the clss was the most engaging online class they had ever taken. I believe that the Google Suite, and applications like it, will become the future of online courses.</p>
